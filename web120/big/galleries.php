<h2>Galleries</h2>
<p>A slider (or slideshow) is a gallery of images that rotate through (usually with images moving left across the page) showing one or a few at a time. They can be designed to automatically rotate through every few seconds or can be designed to be clicked through, either with a mouse or the left or right arrow key on a desktop or by swiping or tapping on mobile. Slider galleries are mostly useful for product images or other similar uses, where the user sees multiple views of the one item, and missing one image won't severely affect the user's understanding.</p>
<p>
Click-through galleries ones are more user-friendly than automatic scrolling ones. The automatic scrolling causes people to miss content that went by too fast, leaving them waiting for it to scroll around again, or more likely they just scroll down the page and forget about what they missed. Thumbnails or breadcrumbs (usually small circles that represent each slide and are either filled in or colored in to represent the active slide) can also help users find a specific slide they are looking for.
Adding a pause button to a slider is an improvement, as users can stop to read the content and click through any links, but even then people are unlikely to pause and go back to a slide they missed because it’s out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>"Banner vision,” the ability to mentally block out sidebar and banner advertisements, affects siders, too. Users filter out sliders mentally, resulting in missed content (usually very important as people use sliders very often for call-to-actions) and they become a waste of space. This is because of the similar full-width horizontal layout to a banner ad, as well as the automatic movement. People get tired of wasting time and attention on constant advertisements, and when they mentally scan a page, they skip over anything that looks like it could be an ad.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>“There was a study done by NNGroup which concluded that carousel information is often ignored. They tested a case where a user wasn’t able to find what they were looking for, even though it was in huge letters, because it was fixed inside a carousel slide.” (Rocheleau)</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter much whether you design a fullscreen carousel or an in-page carousel. Rotation is never a great choice from a usability perspective.” (Rocheleau)</p>
<p>“Carousels do perform well when expected, like in a slideshow or a digital portfolio gallery. But they should always be manually controlled to let visitors choose when to advance or move back a slide. Pointless carousels add nothing and usually damage the UX by wasting a lot of space on the screen.” (Rocheleau)</p>
<p>“Critics argue sliders are confusing since they present users with several options at once, all of which have the same weight or importance. Since UX is about making choices clear, they say anything that creates confusion should be avoided.” (Smith)</p>
<p>“Users stay engaged: Visitors linger in one place to view content, and visuals provide a break before continuing down the page. Sliders consolidate images: While media on the page can draw attention away from text, sliders put it all in one place to prevent distractions.” (Smith)</p>
