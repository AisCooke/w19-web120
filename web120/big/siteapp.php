<h2>Responsive Websites vs. Mobile Apps</h2>
<p>Responsive websites are cheaper to create and can work well across all platforms as long as they are designed to work with most browsers. They are easily found through search engines, whereas apps are more often fount on app stores than through search engines. Responsive websites can be easy to navigate for those already familiar with using the site on a desktop, as it will have the same branding, look and feel, and information architecture, with the main difference being the collapse and reorder of certain items, and a mobile or hamburger menu.</p>
<p>Mobile applications are more expensive to build as they are platform specific. Separate apps need to be created for each platform, such as iOS, Android, BlackBerry, or Windows. The plus side of individual apps for individual platforms is that the look, feel and navigation can be tailored to the platform for better User Experience. Each platform has ways of navigating that its users are used to, so with individually tailored apps, the designer can work with rather than against these patterns. Apps are mostly found through the platform’s app store (like Google Play (Android), App Store (iOS) or Microsoft Store (some Windows phones)), which can provide free advertising if the app is in the newly released section or similar, but otherwise can be hard to sift through.</p>
<p>The benefit to the app store, however, there is the possibility of monetizing your app. It is much easier and more common to charge for use of an app, either monthly or upon download, than for the use of a website (though some News sites do). Many apps are paid, compared to relatively few websites. There is about equal opportunity for ads on apps and responsive websites (banners, pop-ups, etc) but studies have shown that people often tune these out.</p>
<p>Apps also have easier access to hardware, which is useful for GPS, and push notifications. An app can request permission all at once upon download, whereas for a website the user has to assign the permissions to the browser and to the website separately, and sometimes multiple times if the permissions are not saved.</p>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>
“First, building a different app for each platform is very expensive if written in each native language.”
“Second, the performance argument that native apps are faster may apply to 3D games or image processing apps, but there is a negligible or unnoticeable performance penalty in a well-built business application using Web technology.” (Charland)</p>
<p>“Vic Gundotra, VP of engineering at Google, claimed that “even Google was not rich enough to support all of the different mobile platforms from Apple’s App Store to those of the BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, Android, and the many variations of the Nokia platform,”6 and this was before HP webOS, MeeGo, and other platforms emerged.” (Charland)</p>
<p>“What responsive web design basically implies is that the use of device specific apps or web applications becomes unnecessary because the content is simply manipulated according to the CSS3 directives provided in order to adapt the content for the screen size of each device.” (Jobe)</p>
<p>“This result confirmed the speculation regarding the performance and functionality of mobile web apps versus native apps, which was that mobile apps could not perform as well as native apps due to the lack of direct access to the device hardware.” (Jobe)</p>
<p>“The greatest advantage of responsive web design is that a library does not have to maintain and update more than one set of content.” (Kim)</p>
<p>“Another advantage is that there is no need for additional promotion of the library’s mobile website, since whenever a library patron accesses the library website on a mobile device, the website automatically adjusts its layout to be mobile-friendly.” (Kim)</p>
<p>“Lastly, the responsive website is likely to take much more time to load than a simplified separate mobile website. The CSS may hide some of the content, but all the content and other files, such as JavaScript libraries, that are used for the full site still get downloaded.” (Kim)</p>
<p>“Slow performance is a common problem in responsive websites, which use the same code base for all devices, including the desktop PC and the smartphone.” (Kim)</p>
<p>“First, we concluded that responsive web design was able to maintain information quality on home functionality, readability content, and enjoyment of using website but not on information architecture between different mobile browser’s sizes.” (Lestari)</p>
<p>“The biggest drawbacks to using responsive websites are firstly that the app cannot be distributed through an app store; this can be a deal breaker if you’re looking to monetize downloads of your app. Secondly, there’s the issue that the user will need constant connectivity to make use of the website. (“Native vs Hybrid vs Responsive”)</p>
<p>“With the average user already using up to 30 apps a month and with more than 250,000 apps being released a year, there may come a point of overload from a user’s perspective. At that point, it is possible that if there are enough well designed mobile websites, that users will move away from apps and back to browsing and individual sites to provide their online experience.” (“Native vs Hybrid vs Responsive”)</p>
<p>“The reason the responsive web approach requires less time and money is that just one development process allows your website to be viewed on most modern mobile browsers.” (“Responsive Web vs Native Apps”)</p>
<p>“UI and UX conventions for iOS, Android, and other operating systems are different. Their look and feel is different, and the user tastes and expectations are diverse, as well. So, if you build an app that is going to be the same for each OS and the web, it will never feel native to users. They likely won’t use your product for long because it just won’t feel natural.” (“Responsive Web vs Native Apps”)</p>
<p>“With native apps, users won’t necessarily need an Internet connection in order to use your product. Once the app has been downloaded, it’s stored directly on their device, so they will be able to access it in every context.” (“Responsive Web vs Native Apps”)</p>
<p>“When people look for information, they don’t go to the app stores at once. It is more likely that they will start with web browsers.  And the results will probably consist mostly of web pages and just a few apps.” (Team)</p>
<p>“While your website is aimed at attracting new or occasional clients your mobile app works with regular clients.” (Team)</p>
<p>“Oh, and you can include push notifications!” (Team)
“The authors discovered that the members of our project team liked to use apps more than mobile websites; it was expected that our users to feel the same. Wisniewski (2011) agreed that apps are more responsive than mobile websites, since ‘apps provide one‐click access, unlike a mobile website that can take several clicks, and text entry, to access’.” (Wong)</p>
