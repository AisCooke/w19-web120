<h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
<p>A shopping cart is the most important part of an online shopping experience. Once you view and decide on what products to purchase, a shopping cart is where you save them to your list and get ready to check out. Because it deals with people's money, it needs to be especially easy to navigate and trustworthy.</p>
<p>
The parts of a shopping cart user interface include a delete item button, a favorite button (to add to a list for later), the product’s name and description, quantity, and total price (adjusts in relation to quantity). It is important that customers are able to see the items they’ve added to their card have actually been added. Otherwise, they keep adding and then get frustrated when they view their card and see that they now have to remove items. It is also helpful to have a drop down mini-cart that shows up when customers add an item. The mini cart should allow them to update the quantity or remove the item. Removing or adding an item should always have immediately visible feedback to show the customer that what they’ve requested has happened. Customers prefer real-time responses to their actions.</p>
<p>
The cart button should be in the top right corner, as that is where people are expecting it. If they have to look too hard to find it, they may leave or may otherwise be frustrated by it. It should immediately and visibly show how many items are in the cart so users can keep track. It a light background behind it is preferable, as users often dont notice dark bars. </p>
<p>
PCMag recommends 2 e-commerce software platforms as “Editor’s Choice”: PinnacleCart and Shopify. They recommend PinnacleCart as the leader because of its usability and feature set, while they say Shopify has become the standard and is easy to use. Shopify is one of the most ubiquitous e-commerce platforms worldwide. There are many other options for shopping carts to suit different purposes.</p>

<h3>Quotes</h3>
<p>“First, we need a container div, which we’ll call ‘.shopping-cart’. Inside the container, we will have a title and three items which will include: two buttons — delete button and favorite button, product image, product name and description, buttons that will adjust quantity of products, total price.” (Dronca)</p>
<p>“Every aspect of a site’s shopping cart interface (full cart page and mini cart) is important to the overall user experience and success of the site.” (Koladzyn)</p>
<p>“The standard is to place the cart icon in the top right corner of an e-commerce site but avoid placing cart icon in dark bars in the top navigation bar. Our brains scan light space (white) looking for site functions, and dark skinny bars can be very easily missed.” (Koladzyn)</p>
<p>“Users don’t want to search the page to find out if an item was added, and you surely don’t want them leaving the shopping process to find out if an item has been added to the shopping cart or not.” (Koladzyn)</p>
<p>“While many of your customers will be shopping while using a virtual private network (VPN) service, there are still plenty who won't. To protect them, make sure your online store and its underliying web hosting provider either offer you a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate or can accommodate a third-party certificate you purchase from someone else.” (Martinez)</p>
<p>“A leader in our e-commerce reviews, PinnacleCart garners our Editors' Choice award with a great usability and a deep feature set, though not without a few limitations.” (Martinez)
<p>“Considered the standard for easy-to-use e-commerce platforms, Shopify gives you everything you need to get your small e-tailing operation off the cocktail napkin and onto the web.” (Martinez)</p>
