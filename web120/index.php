 <p>My name is Aisling Cooke. This site is my assignment portal for Web 120 at Seattle Central</p>
 <p>I am working an Associates of Applied Sciences in Web Design, and once I graduate, I plan to either turn my part-time freelance business full-time or start work on a Bachelors.</p>
 <p>My hobbies include watching Netflix and cooking with friends. I love dogs and have fostered in the past but dont have enough space, time or money at the moment, so I'm following Sara's footsteps and putting dogs as my images for this page.</p>
